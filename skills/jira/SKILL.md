description: Interact with Atlassian Jira via the atl CLI — read, create, update, delete, and search issues, manage comments, and browse projects. Use when the user wants to work with Jira content (e.g. "get the issue", "create a Jira ticket", "search Jira", "list projects", "add a comment").

# Jira (atl CLI)

## Prerequisites

Before running any Jira command, verify the CLI is available and authenticated:

1. Run `atl --version`. If it fails, stop and tell the user:

   > The `atl` CLI is not installed. Install it with `npm i -g @ai-foundry/atlassian-bridge` and then run `atl auth login`.
   >
   > **Note:** `atl` is NOT the official Atlassian CLI. It is a community project (`@ai-foundry/atlassian-bridge`).

2. Run `atl auth status`. If not authenticated, stop and tell the user:
   > You are not logged in. Run `atl auth login` to authenticate with your Atlassian account.

Only proceed once both checks pass.

## Guidelines

- When the user mentions an issue, expect a key like `PROJ-123`. Use it directly with `atl jira issues get`.
- For search, build a valid JQL query from the user's intent (e.g. `project = PIXEL AND status = "In Progress" AND assignee = currentUser()`).
- When creating issues, `--project` and `--type` are required. Common types: `Task`, `Bug`, `Story`, `Epic`, `Sub-task`.
- When creating or updating issues with `--description`, the value must be valid ADF (Atlassian Document Format) JSON.
- When adding or updating comments with `--body`, the value must be valid ADF JSON. Wrap in single quotes to prevent shell expansion of brackets.
- For `get`, `update`, and `delete` on comments, `--issue` is required to identify which issue the comment belongs to.
- Always show the user the command you are about to run before executing it.
